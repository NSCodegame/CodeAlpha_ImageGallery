## üì∏ How It Works

1. All media files (images/videos) are listed in a `media` array in `script.js`.
2. Buttons are generated dynamically to filter media by category (`Image`, `Videos`, `All`).
3. Clicking an item opens it in a full-screen **lightbox**, with:
   - Navigation buttons
   - Keyboard support
   - Adjustable height via slider
4. The **"Surprise Me!"** button randomly selects any media item to display in the lightbox.
